%{ \doublespacing 

This coursereader is only in its early stages, and we would like to hear your feedback for how we can improve. From small typos to egregious errors; from things you like to things you don't---tell us! \par 

Email can be cumbersome and awkward at times (do I send a whole email for one small typo, even though it's really bugging me?), so please use this anonymous feedback form:\\ \url{http://bit.ly/2nNgDCu}---yes, even for those typos. \par 

Better yet, if you would like to contribute to this project, you can find it \href{https://github.com/Enze-Chen/mse_142_cr}{on GitHub}. Feel free to shoot Enze Chen \href{mailto:enze.chen1@gmail.com}{an email} if you have any questions. \par

Thank you for your help in improving this course! \par
